    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, My name is Paul. I was born in the Philippines but moved to Canada
      in 2009. It was a <strong>big</strong> change for me. My older brother and
      I had met our dad before but for my younger brother. It was the
      <em>first time</em> he has seen my dad.
